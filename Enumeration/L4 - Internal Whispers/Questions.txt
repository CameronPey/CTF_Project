Your red team has successfully gained access to a compromised internal server. During post-exploitation, you retrieved a snapshot of the /home/ directory.

Inside, several users have left behind various files — configuration scripts, diaries, notes... even backups. But somewhere in the middle of this digital clutter, one file holds something valuable: a hidden flag.

Use your enumeration skills to crawl through the directories and uncover the file, the owner, and the flag itself.

🗂️ Objectives:
📌 User Count
How many users are listed in the /home/ directory?

📌 Flag Ownership
Which user owns the file named note.txt that contains the flag?

📌 Hidden Message
What is the flag stored inside note.txt?

Flag format: FLAG-{xxxx-xxxx-xxxx}
