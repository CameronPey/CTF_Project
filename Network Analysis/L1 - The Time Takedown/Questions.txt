Our internal threat intel team intercepted suspicious DNS traffic from a segmented internal lab environment. Initial analysis suggests a potential misconfigured system—or worse, an exfiltration attempt disguised as time synchronization and localhost lookups. Your task is to investigate the DNS patterns and uncover the details behind the traffic anomalies.

Analyze the packet traces or logs and answer the following:

🕵️‍♂️ Network Analysis: DNS & Query Investigation
Q1: Requesting the Time
One of the devices initiated a DNS query to time.nist.gov, possibly to reach out to a time server for synchronization.
🔍 Which source IP address made the request?

Q2: Denied and Refused
That same device was met with multiple DNS refusals when attempting to resolve the A record of time.nist.gov.
🛑 Which IP address was repeatedly denied during these attempts?

Q3: Query to Nowhere
A different host tried to resolve localhost through an external DNS provider (8.8.8.8), which should never happen in a secure environment. It received a Destination unreachable response.
🌐 Which IP address sent this improper query?
