## üß† Concepts & Techniques

Use these resources to understand and apply network analysis fundamentals:

- Capture and analyze traffic using packet sniffers (Wireshark, tcpdump)
- Filter specific protocol traffic (DNS, HTTP, TLS, ICMP, etc.)
- Inspect DNS records and query behaviors
- Reconstruct files and sessions from PCAPs
- Identify malicious payloads, beaconing behavior, or exfiltration attempts
- Interpret HTTP headers and request patterns
- Understand TCP/IP models and flow behavior
- Investigate SSL/TLS handshakes and certificate info
- Monitor real-time traffic using IDS like Zeek or Suricata

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Reminder

Only analyze network traffic on systems and networks you own or have explicit permission to inspect. Unauthorized monitoring or sniffing of data is illegal and unethical.
